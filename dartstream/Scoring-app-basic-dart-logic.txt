To calculate a 3-dart average in darts, add up the total points scored in a round or leg, and divide that number by the total number of darts thrown. Then, multiply that result by three to get your average score per three darts. For example, a player scoring 501 points in 15 darts would have a 3-dart average of 100.2 (501 ÷ 15 x 3 = 100.2). 

In darts, a "leg" is a single game, typically starting with each player on 501 points and ending when a player reduces their score to exactly zero by finishing on a double. Multiple legs are played to win a "set" (the most common format is the best of five legs, where a player needs to win three legs) and multiple sets are played to win the entire match. 

In darts, "set play" is a format where matches are won by winning a certain number of "sets," and each set is won by winning a specific number of "legs". A leg is a single game of 501, and a set is usually won by the first player to win three legs (a "best of five" format). The number of sets needed to win the match varies based on the tournament and round, with longer matches required for later stages. 
Key terms in set play

Leg: A single game of darts, usually starting from 501 points, with the first player to reach zero and finish on a double winning the leg.

Set: A group of legs. A player wins a set by winning a predetermined number of legs, typically three out of a possible five.

Match: The overall competition, which is won by the first player to win the required number of sets. 

How it works
Players compete in legs: A leg is a standard 501 game, where players subtract their score from 501 after each visit of three darts until they reach zero.
Winning a leg: To win a leg, a player must reach exactly zero and their final dart must land on a double segment or the bullseye.
Winning a set: A set consists of a best-of-five legs format, meaning the first player to win three legs wins the set.
The core difference is the scope of darts included in the calculation: the leg average only counts darts in a single leg, while the match average accounts for all darts thrown across the entire match, including lost legs and missed doubles. 

Leg Average
A leg average is a snapshot of performance for one single game (leg) of 501. 
Calculation: (Total points scored in the leg / number of darts thrown in that leg) x 3.
Logic: If a player wins a leg, their total points scored is exactly 501. The average is a pure measure of how many darts it took them to complete that specific leg. If they lose, the average is based on the points they did score with the darts they threw.
Significance: It highlights efficiency and performance within a contained scenario, often a player's best performance in a winning leg. 

Match Average
The match average is an overall measure of a player's performance throughout the entire match.
